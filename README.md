# Machine_Learning_Examples

# Introduction 
This repository contains machine learning examples from scratch and sklearn library. Mostly examples will be applicable for different type of csv files. Keep in mind csv files should not contain a string, for scratch last column needs to be output and  because of sklearn `train_test_split` and `numpy.random.shuffle` commands shuffles dataset different, accuracies may not be same.
